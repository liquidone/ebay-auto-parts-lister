# eBay API Compliance Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the compliance requirements and implementation for eBay's Marketplace Account Deletion/Closure Notification process.

## What eBay Requires

eBay requires all applications using their APIs to handle user account deletion/closure notifications. This is part of their data privacy and GDPR compliance requirements.

### Required Endpoints

Your application must provide these endpoints that eBay can call:

1. **Account Deletion Notification Endpoint**
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/ebay/account-deletion-notification`
   - Method: POST
   - Purpose: Receive notifications when eBay users request account deletion

2. **Verification Challenge Endpoint**
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/ebay/verification-challenge`
   - Method: POST
   - Purpose: Handle eBay's verification challenges

3. **Compliance Status Endpoint**
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/ebay/compliance-status`
   - Method: GET
   - Purpose: Check compliance implementation status

## Implementation Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - All required endpoints have been implemented in your application:

- `/ebay/account-deletion-notification` - Handles deletion notifications
- `/ebay/verification-challenge` - Handles verification challenges
- `/ebay/compliance-status` - Shows compliance status

## Your Application URLs

Once deployed to your VPS, these will be your compliance endpoints:

- **Account Deletion**: `http://143.110.157.23/ebay/account-deletion-notification`
- **Verification**: `http://143.110.157.23/ebay/verification-challenge`
- **Status**: `http://143.110.157.23/ebay/compliance-status`

## How It Works

### 1. Data Handling
Your application **does not store personal eBay user data**, which simplifies compliance:
- You only process auto part images
- You generate listings based on image analysis
- No personal user information is stored or cached

### 2. Notification Process
When eBay sends a deletion notification:
1. Your endpoint receives the notification
2. The request is logged for compliance records
3. Since no personal data is stored, no deletion is needed
4. A confirmation response is sent back to eBay

### 3. Logging
All compliance notifications are logged to:
- File: `logs/ebay_notifications.log`
- Format: JSON with timestamp and notification details

## Next Steps for eBay API Approval

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Application
```bash
# SSH to your VPS
ssh root@143.110.157.23

# Navigate to app directory
cd /opt/ebay-auto-parts-lister

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Restart the application
sudo systemctl restart ebay-auto-parts-lister
```

### Step 2: Test Compliance Endpoints
```bash
# Test the compliance status endpoint
curl http://143.110.157.23/ebay/compliance-status
```

### Step 3: Submit to eBay
1. Go to your eBay Developer Account
2. Navigate to your application settings
3. Add these notification URLs:
   - **Account Deletion URL**: `http://143.110.157.23/ebay/account-deletion-notification`
   - **Verification URL**: `http://143.110.157.23/ebay/verification-challenge`

### Step 4: Request API Key Activation
1. Submit your compliance implementation
2. Request review of your disabled keyset
3. Provide the notification endpoint URLs
4. Explain that your app doesn't store personal user data

## Compliance Statement

**Data Retention Policy**: This application does not store, cache, or retain any personal eBay user data. The application only processes auto part images for identification and listing generation purposes.

**Deletion Process**: Since no personal user data is stored, the notification endpoint serves as a logging mechanism for compliance records only.

**Endpoint Availability**: All required notification endpoints are implemented and available 24/7 on the production server.

## Troubleshooting

### Check Endpoint Status
```bash
# Test compliance status
curl http://143.110.157.23/ebay/compliance-status

# Check application logs
sudo journalctl -u ebay-auto-parts-lister -n 20

# Check compliance logs
tail -f /opt/ebay-auto-parts-lister/logs/ebay_notifications.log
```

### Common Issues
1. **Endpoint not responding**: Check if application is running
2. **404 errors**: Verify the URL paths are correct
3. **500 errors**: Check application logs for Python errors
